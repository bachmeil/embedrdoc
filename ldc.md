**Can I use LDC?**

Of course. In fact, that is the only way I've found to use embedr on
Windows or Mac. You're on your own for now because I don't have
either of those OSes to play with. I'm always happy to answer questions
if you want to try. File an issue on the [Bitbucket repo](https://bitbucket.org/bachmeil/embedr/src/master/).
